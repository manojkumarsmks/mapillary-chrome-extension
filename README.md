Mapillary Chrome & Firefox extension
===================

Browser extension for [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/) that shows a random beautiful image from [Mapillary](https://www.mapillary.com) every time you open a new tab. Download it on the [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mapillary-%E2%80%93-crowdsourced/lkokbfpnhgcnkhecedjgdemlohbaomjd) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/mapillary/).

## Install

Clone this repo and then run `npm install`

## Running

`npm start` will start a local server and open a new tab with the page.

Alternatively, you can navigate to `chrome://extensions` in Chrome and drag-and-drop the whole folder there. That way you'll install the extension and it will also update automatically as you change the code.
